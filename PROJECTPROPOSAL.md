PROJECT: Comp Sci, The Card Game (CSTCG)
By Team (a)MiRiCa (Michael Brockman, Rizky Pratama, Cavin Zeng)

CSTCG is a pokemon-style card game played by two players. Each player has 2 cards in play at a time with 3 more in reserve. Each card has an attack, B move, and a Special move. The objective of the game is to beat your oponent by knocking out 2 of your opponent's cards.

Custom classes will be created for the cards. Superclasses will be created for the attacks, b moves, special moves, and conditions. A TreeSet will be used to contain all of the cards, as well as to contain the cards in play and in reserve. An ArrayList in each of the card objects is used to keep track of condition.

Files will be used to store card data and grab the images. A new file that details the battle log will be created as well.

Incorporating image files into our project will be a new thing for us. We may also consider implementing sound fx and audio as well.
